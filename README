Description
-----------

These are just various tools I use in development.

I'm releasing all these scripts into the public domain. Feel free to fork them
and modify them all you want. If you think your changes might be useful to
others, let me know and I'll be happy to merge them.


Ruby paths
----------

Since these scripts rely on external gems, they are designed to integrate
cleanly with RVM for those who use it. Simply choose a Ruby version and gemset
and run

  rvm wrapper <version>@<gemset> wisq_utils
  
then run

  wisq_utils_gem install bundler
  wisq_utils_ruby -e 'exec("bundle install")'

to install the required gems.

If you are running with a global Ruby rather than RVM, you can just create a
symbolic link to your Ruby executable (typically /usr/bin/ruby), name it
"wisq_utils_ruby", and put it somewhere in your $PATH.


Obligatory legal stuff
----------------------

These tools are released with NO WARRANTY. Although I try to write code that
will operate safely and not destroy data, I make no guarantees. You use these
tools at your own risk.
